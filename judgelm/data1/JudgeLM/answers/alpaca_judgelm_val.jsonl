The first and most obvious way is to switch to a different internet provider. Many providers offer promotional deals and discounts that can significantly cut down the cost of using their services. Another way to cut down the cost is to switch to a different type of connection. Wireless connections such as Wi-Fi and cellular data can often be cheaper than traditional cable connections. Finally, it is also possible to reduce the speed of the connection without reducing the overall quality of the internet experience. By lowering the bandwidth, users can decrease the amount of data they use and in turn, decrease their internet bill.", "scores": {}}
